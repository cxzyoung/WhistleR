CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0
------------------------

    o Workflow: The wrapper function genomeDerivedFeatures() 
      could annotate >200 genomic features given TxDb or EnsDb, 
      BSgenome, and GScores objects. Individual functions to create 
      Genomic features using other metric & region combinations 
      are still accessible.

    o Messages: The message generated by genomeDerivedFeatures()
      will display the feature name and information. Numeric indexes are also added at 
      the beginning of each feature.
